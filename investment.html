              Albania has outstanding solar insolation within most of its
              territory at more than 1 500 kWh/m2 annually, with highs of 1 753
              kWh/m2 annually, particularly in the western part of the country.
              The country has some of Europe’s highest number of sunshine hours
              per year, presenting significant potential for development of
              solar PV for power generation and solar thermal for heating
              purposes. On average, the country enjoys 220 sunshine days, or 2
              700 hours of sunshine per year.

            <h3>
              Albania is in the very early stages of geothermal assessment.
              However, similar to other South East European countries,
              low-enthalpy geothermal energy resources are available in
              Albania.The geothermal regime of geological structures in the
              territory of Albania is conditioned by the density of heat flux,
              geothermal gradient and distribution of the temperature at
              different depths of these sources, closely related to the
              lithology and tectonics of geological structures, as well as
              groundwater hydrodynamics. This regime also conditions geothermal
              energy resources.

            <h1>BIOMASS</h1>
            <h3>
              The logic behind biomass energy is simple. Trees and plants absorb
              carbon dioxide from the air, use photosynthesis to isolate the
              carbon, and then use it to build tree trunks, bark and leaves. But
              when the plant dies, it rots down and much of the carbon is
              released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. When we use
              biomass as an energy source, we are intercepting this carbon
              cycle, using that stored energy productively rather than it just
              being released into nature.One way to improve the use of biomass
              energy is by creating storage doms for wood pellets. Most of the
              pellets are made from the sawmill residues and waste left over
              from managed forestry.

              Hydropower dominates Albania’s electricity sector with 2 096 MW of
              installed capacity at the end of 2018, representing 95% of total
              installed power generation capacity.The River Drin alone generates
              about 90% of Albania’s domestic electricity supply.Mountainous
              Albania, in Europe's Western Balkans region, is home to eight
              major river systems. The country is almost totally dependent on
              hydropower for electricity supply.

          One way of using biomass energy is to convert Agriculture and forestry
          products and wood processing remains into combustible gas. The First
          step is biomass gasification, which convert biomass into syngas. The
          Second step is syngas purification. The Third step is power generating
          in gas engine. 1) Clean technology. Biomass, as one kind of renewable
          energy,may reduce the emission of carbon dioxide causing from fossil
          fuel. 2) Economical. Even small size biomass power plant is also
          profitable process and less land requirements make biomass
          gasification power plant more economical comparing with other
          renewable energy.
